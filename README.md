# Alpaca API Insomnia Workspace

If you're unfamiliar, [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) is a technology platform for financial services including a paper trading API as well as a live commission free stock trading API (_brokerage services are offered offered through Alpaca Securities LLC_).

While building applications using [Alpaca API](https://docs.alpaca.markets), it's often helpful to be able to manually test API requests to see what's going on. It can help you debug your own code and also learn the API in a more hands on way.

The JSON file in this repository can be imported into [Insomnia REST API client](https://insomnia.rest).

Import this JSON file into Insomnia and rename the workspace to make a copy of it.

Adjust the environment variables as needed, adding your access keys.
